# Human Machine Interface (IHM) for SVM Machine Learning Models

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for a Human Machine Interface (IHM) developed as part of a project for end-of-studies. The IHM is designed to interact with Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning models. This README provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for interacting with SVM models.
- Load pre-trained SVM models.
- Visualize data.
- Perform model evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: tkinter, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zineb1224/PFEProject.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd PFEProject
```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Run the main application script:

```bash
python interfaceGraphique.py
```

2. Use the interface to load or train SVM models, visualize data, make predictions, and evaluate model performance.
